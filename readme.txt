********************* Instruction *************************
This is the final project of Data Visualization Course.
I am using TCCIP typhoon dataset as example.

*** How to run the code? ***
Open "index.html" file and run it with the Live Server extension in VSCode.
Make sure the json and csv files are in the "data" folder, or you can modify it in "main.js" constants.

*** Functions of the project ***
1. Filter typhoon paths by year interval or typhoon names.
2. Switch map to Taiwan only by clicking the slider at the top-right corner of the map.
3. Filter year interval of total precipitation in its barchart.
4. Filter year interval of total number of typhoons in its barchart.
5. Buttons for resetting map and filters in barcharts
